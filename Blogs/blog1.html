                    Jim Cantrell, who was an aerospace consultant at the time, became SpaceX's first VP of business
                    development and Musk's industry mentor when the company launched in 2002. He says that Musk
                    literally taught himself rocket science by reading textbooks and talking to industry heavyweights.
                </p>

                <p>Cantrell's first contact with Musk was a cold call in 2001. As he explains to Esquire:
                    "I had the top down on my car, so all I could make out was that some guy named Ian Musk was saying
                    that he was an Internet billionaire and needed to talk to me. I'm pretty sure he used that phrase,
                    'Internet billionaire.'"</p>
                <p>
                    Musk learned about Cantrell through Robert Zubrin, the founder of the Mars Society. Musk knew that
                    Cantrell was an expert in Russian rockets and wanted to learn how he could get a spacecraft to Mars.
                </p>



                <p> "He is the smartest guy I've ever met, period," Cantrell tells us. "I know that sounds overblown.
                    But I've met plenty of smart people, and I don't say that lightly. He's absolutely, frickin'
                    amazing. I don't even think he sleeps." Cantrell tells us that he soon discovered that he and Musk
                    shared an affinity for applied knowledge, and he loaned him some textbooks to study (they "were
                    never returned, by the way!" Cantrell says).</p>

                    <h2><strong>He build a network of smartest people</strong></h2>

                <p>
                    Musk "knows everything about what he's building," Cantrell says, but of course even he understands
                    that he can't master everything. That's why he used Cantrell's network in the aerospace industry to
                    gather some of the best in the business. "It was like spaceapalooza!"
                    For example, they hired the rocket engineer Tom Mueller, who Cantrell says is the smartest
                    propulsion expert out there. Musk respected his deep knowledge and let him take care of things that
                    he'd learned from years of research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the same way that Musk absorbed books, he tried doing that with other people's expertise. "It was
                    as if he would suck the experience out of them. He truly listens to people," Cantrell says.
