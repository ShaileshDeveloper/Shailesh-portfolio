Before we start out on why java script can you think of why even programming languages?
001010100 10010010010   1001010100 {images}


 do know you the above image that you see is the output for
 

 earlier to get the out put of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55  we have to right the code as in the above image,imagine writing code for a big program that will be near to imposible,,

 count=1;
 total=0;
 for(count;count<=10;count++){
     total= total+count;
 }
 console.log(total);


 and this program you see write there gives the same output;


 Thats what programming language gives you ,its makes it much each easy to use it helps with different functions loops so you don't have to worry about execution of program again and again.

 There are so many programming languages out there so why i chose javascript as my first programming language;{
     1 : Its syntax is closest thing to english language not like other programming language like(stdio.h ,conio.h) you know which language i am talking about stop pretending.
     2 : Its editor is present in every laptop that has a weeb browser(can you imagine how many people have access to write code in javascript without downloading anything)
     3 : Its damn user friendly ,(even if miss out some typos such as semicolon and all , you dont have to worry much about your program it will runcompletely fine)
     4 : Many databases such as mongo DB, couchDB also uses the javascript as there scripting and query language.
     5 : Well this is the 5 and main important one tanay bhaiya said javascript he best hai;
     6 : Well it can be used to make native apps,websites which will be very helpful if you want to pursue as free lancer
